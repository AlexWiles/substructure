## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.15] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Changelog with automated release notes.

### Changed

- Agent state is serialized as JSON automatically; chains no longer need an
  explicit `.use(agent.jsonState())`. Existing chains that still include it
  keep working, and the wire format is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Tool-result messages (`message.new` with `role: "tool"`) now carry the tool
  `name` instead of `null`, so consumers reading only the message stream (e.g.
  reconstructing a transcript from session events) no longer have to correlate
  `tool_call_id` back to the originating tool call to recover the name.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- SDK typing and developer-experience improvements.
